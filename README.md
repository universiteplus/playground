## What is Playground

Playground is an open list of challenges to showcase any developers' skills, competence, and expertise.

If you are a company or anyone who seeks a developer, it provides you a well defined, sandboxed and conventional way of testing your candidate's skill and expertise. You can either select a challenge that is suitable for your case, or take any work as a base(and then create your own). 

If you are someone who is challenged with any of these challenges, you should find the challenge, navigate to its repo, fork it, and start working.


## Rationale

Acquiring new talents is a hard and long process, for both companies and developers. Requesting CV's, meeting the person face-to-face(or remote), requiring references of the works she has done are certainly a way to go, but any of these things does not give a better understanding on how your company/team and she are a good match. To overcome this issue, companies often send technical challenges to their candidates, invite her to work with them for a day or two, or give them test-drive tasks in the beginning.

A well defined and well tailored challenge can give a big hint about what a company does, how much the candidate fits in and saves lots of time.

A conventional and open way of challenging, on the other hand, provides a clean process, and leverages some tools that every companies/developers should use.

## How to Challenge

1. Plan a simple task, app, library or plugin which contains the essence of the work you are doing.
2. Use any of the challenges/drafts as the starting point, open your repo, and copy the template README.md
3. Write down your list of features. Make sure that they are not complicated and whole challenge can be done in a man's day. (2-8 hours)
2. Express skill sets, tools, and technologies you want to be used.
3. Provide some links to how-tos, assets, libraries, and any other dependencies you require. 
4. Link your challenge repo to your candidate and require her to fork.
5. Observe.
6. When she is done, evaluate the work she has done.
